# Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
This is a repository of artificial intelligence projects I've been working on from time to time. You can find algorithm that were coded from scratch in different languages including Java, Python and C++. The algorithm range from classical artificial intelligence search algorithm to machine learning and deep learning algorithm. If you would like to have a certain algorithm coded and explained you are welcome to open up an [issue](https://github.com/yacineMahdid/artificial-intelligence-from-scratch/issues).

I also have implementation of ai/ml to real world project, see the table of content below for a sneak-peak of the projects!

## Table of Content
- [Deep Learning from Scratch in Python](https://github.com/yacineMahdid/artificial-intelligence-from-scratch/tree/master/Deep%20Learning%20from%20Scratch%20in%20Python) ‚öô : Implementation of all the components of a deep neural network including perceptron, gradientd escent, backpropagation, forward propagation etc.
- [Neural Network From Scratch in Java](https://github.com/yacineMahdid/artificial-intelligence-from-scratch/tree/master/Neural%20Network%20From%20Scratch) üï∏Ô∏è : A simple implementation of a fully-connected feedforward neural network in Java. The forward and backward propagation were implemented using no library!
- [Artificial Intelligence Search Algorithm in Java](https://github.com/yacineMahdid/artificial-intelligence-from-scratch/tree/master/AI%20Search%20Algorithm%20in%20Java) ‚òï : informed and uninformed search algorithm including breadth first search, depth first search, iterative deepening search, greedy search,steepest ascent hill climbing and A*!
- [EEG Headset Converter with KNN in MATLAB](https://github.com/yacineMahdid/artificial-intelligence-from-scratch/tree/master/EEG%20Headset%20Converter%20with%20KNN) üß† : A real life example of the KNN algorithm being put to use to match two electroencephalographic headset who have different electrodes topology. An implementation of the KNN is also given.
- [Linear Regression in C++](https://github.com/yacineMahdid/artificial-intelligence-from-scratch/tree/master/Linear%20Regression%20in%20C%2B%2B) üìà : In this project we implement a multivariate linear regression algorithm from scratch using C++.
- [Neural Style Transfer in Pytorch](https://github.com/yacineMahdid/artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning/tree/master/Neural%20Style%20Transfer%20(Original%20Version)) üé®: This is the original neural style transfer paper Pytorch implementation! I've followed the amazing tutorial from the Pytorch documentation, however I've made quite a few modification to the code so that it is a bit cleaner to work with.
